Using Selenium and Python, I have automated Sephora's website testing for the followiing task:

Use Case: User should be able to see how many products appear when they search for something in the search bar.

Steps:
1. User enters the site address www.sephora.com
2. User locates the search bar on top of the webpage and searches for a product. Eg. Lipstick
3. User enters on the lipstick search product webpage
4. User sees a list of lipsticks sorted in default way (relevancy)

Automation:

All these steps, automated. Only thing that user has to put is the product type (lipsticks) and all the info will be automatically scraped and displayed.
